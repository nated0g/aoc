# üéÑ My Advent of Code Solutions in Rust ü¶Ä

My journey through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in Rust. This repository contains my solutions and the tools I use to manage them.

## üìù Structure

- Solutions are organized by year and day
- Inputs are stored in `src/inputs/y20xx/dayxx.txt` (not comitted to the repository, as they are unique to each user and not meant to be shared)
- Unit tests use the example inputs provided in each puzzle

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

I use [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli) to manage puzzle inputs and submissions.

You can install it with
```bash
cargo install aoc-cli
```
Then, check the `aoc-cli` repo for how to set up your session variable.

Two helper scripts are provided:

### fetch.sh
Downloads puzzle input and description:
```bash
./fetch.sh 2023 1  # Downloads day 1 of year 2023
```

### solve.sh
Runs solution and submits answer:
```bash
./solve.sh 2023 1 1  # Submits part 1 of day 1, 2023
```

# Run tests
cargo test
```
