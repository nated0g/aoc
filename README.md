## My Advent of Code (AoC) solutions ðŸŽ„ in Rust ðŸ¦€

My attempts at solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems as a way to learn Rust.  To function properly, inputs must be in `src/inputs/y20xx` and named `dayxx.txt`, etc.

I use the [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli) to fetch the input and puzzle text quickly, as well as to submit my answers.
